title: 2nd MirageOS hack retreat (March 2017, Marrakesh, Morocco)
author: Camels

Once again, we've gathered at [Priscilla](http://queenofthemedina.com/en/index.html) to work on and play with [MirageOS](https://mirage.io).

- Several WiFi credentials are in use; among them are `hackretreat`, `hackathon`, and the tajine-related one listed on the counter on the ground floor.
- We hang out in the sun and on IRC in `#mirage` (`irc.freenode.net`).
- Circle at noon on the roof, lunch at 1, dinner at 7:30.
- You can clone this repository from https://github.com/mirage/canopy-data and add your own items, particularly in the Projects and Posts directories :)
- Please don't stream stuff, and turn wifi off when you're not using it (phones, etc)
- The dog's name is Mihow and she's a bit fearful, so you might want to let her get to know you a bit before trying to pet her.

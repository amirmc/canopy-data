abstract: a syslog implementation in OCaml

*Status:* running, and [syslog is well integrated in MirageOS 3](http://docs.mirage.io/mirage/Mirage/index.html#type-syslog_config) via [logs-syslog](https://github.com/hannesm/logs-syslog).

[Syslog](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424) is a standard protocol used to convey event notification messages. It would be nice to have a unikernel that could act as a `syslogd` receiver. The unikernel would listen appropriately (initially in cleartext though SSL/TLS support is also desirable), receive and verify syslog messages, and then write them into an Irmin store.

* Basic implementation underway <https://github.com/verbosemode/syslog-message>
